Slides of a recent talk by me at the FOSSASIA Summit 2019, Singapore.

Title: <b>Exploring Augmented Reality for Mobile</b>

The talk focuses on the basics of Augmented Reality and the various aspects which make it possible, in a mobile context. In addition, we will also be seeing how various libraries (ARCore, esp) are handling the key features of AR. 

An exploration of some current problems being faced is done, and links to Machine Learning (or AI in general) are drawn to potentially eliminate them.
